Ethical Considerations – EcoShare 

Data Privacy 

EcoShare may collect basic user information such as names, contact details, and item locations. There is a risk that this information could be misused if not handled properly. Protecting user privacy is important to ensure trust and prevent unauthorised access to personal data. 

Security 

Users will create accounts and communicate with others through the platform. Weak security could allow unauthorised access, fake accounts, or impersonation. EcoShare must consider secure authentication and protect users from potential misuse of the system. 

Trust and User Safety 

EcoShare connects people who may not know each other. This creates possible safety risks during item exchanges. There is also a risk of misleading or false item listings. The platform should encourage honest behaviour and provide guidance for safe exchanges. 

Environmental Impact 

Although EcoShare promotes reuse, second-hand items can still contribute to environmental impact through transportation and handling. The platform aims to reduce overall waste by encouraging local sharing rather than long-distance exchanges. 

Accessibility and Inclusion 

The system should be easy to use for people with different abilities and levels of technical experience. Poor design choices could unintentionally exclude some users. EcoShare should aim for a clear and accessible interface.

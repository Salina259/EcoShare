## Eco Share Items
Eco Share is a community-focused, full-stack web application that enables users to share and exchange belongings and everyday items for mutual benefit rather than financial gain. The platform promotes reuse, waste reduction, and community support, helping users access items they need while preventing usable goods from being discarded.

The application aligns with the 2026 theme “Sharing, exchange and building community” by encouraging reuse, cooperation, and local community engagement. Eco Share provides a digital space where users can list items they no longer need and request items from others, keeping usable goods in circulation and out of landfill.
